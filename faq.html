    <p>How do I get paid?
        Step 1) Find out how much your ores are worth
        Inventory
        Open the inventory
        Press [CTRL] + [A] to select all ores
        Press [CTRL] + [C] to copy them
        Insert it into the calculator using [CTRL] + [V].
        With the field "Split" you can set whether the ores should be split.
        This is useful for example if you have mined with a friend and want to split the ISK.
        
        Note: [Right click] and [Select all] / [Copy] is also possible.
        
        
        
         
        
        
        Step 2) Create a contract
        
        Note: The ores must be on a station - preferably on our Corps own.
        
        Open the inventory
        Press [CTRL] + [A] to mark all ores
        [Right click] and select [Create Contract].
        There you make the following settings:
         
        
        Page 1 of 4:
        Availability: My Corporation
         
        
        Page 2 of 4:
        Here again your ores are shown
        
         
        
        Page 3 of 4:
        I will recieve: Here you enter the price you calculated
        Expiration: 3 days
        Description: Here you can hold smaller praises on our Lord Oh Shit
         
        
        Page 4 of 4:
        Here you can see a listing again
        If everything meets your requirements, simply press "Next".
        
         
        
        
        
        
        Step 3) Profit
        Fleet Mining
        Mining with a fleet is very simple. You look in the fleet finder if a fleet is open, you join them and go to them. 
        
         
        
        Now you stay within a radius of ~2.5km of the Mining Foreman's (the Orca). You now benefit from a 40% increased mining speed. You can put your ores into the Orca's fleet hangar.
        
        You can open the fleet hangar by right-clicking on the orca. At the end of the fleet, you will either get the ores you have mined or the Corp will buy them from you, depending on your decision. 
        
        Important: 
        
        Within a fleet put all ores into the orca.
        Picking up ores from containers is strictly forbidden. 
        The dropping of ores is only possible with the agreement of the Mining Foreman.
         
        
        Mining Foreman
        A Mining Foreman, is the pilot of an Orca within a fleet. He is in principle responsible for the payment of all the ores and to bring the ores to the cooperation. In return for his services and to compensate for the costs he incurs, he receives 10% ISK of ore mined from the fleet members.

        A: These systems are to be preferred. There, your ores are purchased directly at the specified stations.
        
         
        
        B: These systems are suitable for mining - however, the ores cannot be compressed in these systems. The Cooperation buys the ores 1 jump away. 
        
         
        
        C: These are systems in which ores can be directly compressed. However, the Corp does not purchase ores here. You have to bring them to Nafrivik on your own.
