            <br>All,
<br>
            <br>Just a fast update for the month. We've had a lot of upsets and changes this year so I figured I would reach out and give an update.
            <br>
            <br>Why we left the alliance.
            <br>Short Answer: We were kicked by the Alliance Leader because he was being a petty child.
            <br>Long Answer: There was some.....disagreement....between myself and Alliance management over PVP kills. Alliance Leader stance was that PVP kills should only happen in defense of yourself, duels, or in defense of assets (yours/corp/alliance). I felt that if a member killed a bot that it was ok and willing to leave it there. At the end of the day, I was not willing to infringe on the way people play their own game so when he threw a tantrum and kicked us, I chose not to seek re-entry. I was tired of being questiond over the "honor" of every kill if someone had anything looking anywhere near an unfair fight. With the stations moved to Holding Corps, we can't be wardec'd so we're just as safe now as we were in teh Alliance.
            <br>
            <br>NOW, with that being said........as far as I am aware. We are still welcome in the Alliance Collab chat 'Phoenix Incorporated'. I, personally, have not rejoined those comm channels, but am in contact with most of the CEOs of the Alliance. I just choose not to engage with the Alliance Leader. As I understand it we are still welcome on all Alliance Moon pops in Jerma, Ice Fleets in Dantan, and so on. We just don't have calendar access to them. As well, Out of the Depths in Neburab still affords us docking and mining rights. Just be sure, like always, to confirm permission to mine on someone else's moon and pay then the 10% of all ore mined on their moon.
            <br>
            <br>Corp Logo Change
            <br>I got tired of that damned horse logo so I changed it to something a little less......odd.
            <br>
            <br>Mining Contracts
            <br>It's come to my attention that some people are going to the trouble of hauling all of their Ore back to Miner's Inn in Nafrivik before contracting. While appreciated, this is not required. Management has discussed it and we are willing to accept contracts just about anywhere between Siyi - Nafrivik - Jerma - Munory. That's a BIG area, but Rival Acid LOVES driving his Charon so we give him every possible chance to enjoy himself. If you are unsure, Check with  Rival Acid before transport and contract. He may have market plans that could be impacted.
            <br>
            <br>Munory
            <br>Our position in Munory grows a little stronger day by day. I am in close contact with all of the Corps/Alliances in system and we have tacit permission to mine on just about every moon station in the system (permission and 10% fees required).
            <br>
            <br>Industry
            <br>MANY MANY Thanks to those of you donating empty/unused Industry reseach slots for researching the BPOs that I have made available. I'm starting to see a few people take advantage of making BPO copies to start industry builds. I myself am nearing completion on a Bowhead before too much longer.
            <br>I have updated the Corp Welcome Aboard Letter to list out the Blueprint program and how it works. Ping me for a copy if you would like a reminder of how to take advantage of it.. The idea is for everyone to dip their toes in industry in one way or another.
            <br>
            <br>I also have made my reaction formulas available in Naguton. The taxes here are on the high side, but it's the closest reactions station that I have found so far. If you would like to start building or doing reactions let me know and I will make a container for you to use.
            <br>
            <br>Courier Contracts
            <br>We have one or two members that specialize in Courier runs. If you need something couriered, reach out to Nerrene and work something out.
            <br>
            <br>BPC's (Blueprint Copies)
            <br>- There is also a folder of BPC's available for all to use at Munory. These are mostly the daily freebie blueprints, but there are occasional gems that end up in there is someone no longer needs a blueprint. Feel free to give and take at will from this container, just be courteous and only take what you intend to utilize.
            <br>
            <br>Slot containers (Salvage)
            <br>- There are numerous containers available labeled for High/Mid/Low Slot in Munory. This is all salvage that has been collected and donated from mission running. This is to be used for outfitting throw-away ships for mining, testing fits, learning PVP, and so on. If you tend to collect everything and don't know what to do with it, consider donating it to the corp and sharing for others to use.
            <br>
            <br>As always, Fly Safe and have a Happy Holidays!
