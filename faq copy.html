						<h3>Welcome! You are POO NOW!</h3>
						<br />Join us and Mine in Munory , Nafrivik , and Siyi <br />You
						want to refine? --> Use Nafrivik - Miners Inn , Munory - Plausible
						Deniability , or Siyi - power plunger <br />You want Industry? -->
						Use Munory - Glory to the Builders and contact OldGuyMonty about
						using the availble BPOs. <br />You want to sell Ores? --> Here is
						some Informtion that explains HOW

						<h3>Wanna get into some industry?</h3>
						<p>
							OldGuyMonty has made his library of BPOs and Reactions accesible
							to the entire corp. Anyone with Scientific Networking can reach
							out from a distance and assist with researching BPOs, make copies,
							or run jobs and use the corporate Production wallet to pay for it.
						</p>

						<p>
							Munory - Glory to the Builders (Control Tower Alt Delete) Is our
							main industry location, but you can build anywhere. Those of you
							who partake in industry can make copies of my BPOs and use them
							for doing industry. Both personal and allaince contract. Just
							please do not abuse the privilage. (See Below)
						</p>

						<p>
							Use of the BPOs and Reactions will be done by placing a container
							in the new hangar with your player name on it and putting your
							build materials inside (ask OldGuyMonty to rename or add a
							container for you). You can then make a BPO copy to place in your
							container and then run the job to and from there while using the
							corp production wallet to pay for it.
						</p>

						<p>
							The Production wallet is limited so please consider donating back
							to it from time to time to help keep it running.
						</p>

						<p>
							We monitor both the Corp industry logs and the Production wallet
							for abuse, so please use the honor system when utilizing both. The
							idea here is participation and getting more people involved in
							industry. For those not interested in industry, please conside
							donating reasearch slot time to help out. Those that don't do
							industry, but use their 1 or 2 research slots for doing long
							research jobs on teh BPOs are helping immensely. And with the
							production wallet to pay for it you're not losing anything.
						</p>

						<p>
							- First and foremost keep in mind, these BPOs and Reaction
							Formulas are the personal property of OldGuyMonty. They are not
							assets owned by the Corporation.
						</p>

						<p>
							- Please make a copy (or copies) of a BPO and have them output to
							your personal corporate build container. This way the BPO frees up
							for somone else to utilize. If you are making multiple copies,
							Please be sure to notify OldGuyMonty and for what purpose. The
							BPOs and Reaction Formulas are being provided for everyone to
							build with, not for continuous copying for personal revenue
							generation. Abuse will lead to losing access privelages.
						</p>

						<p>
							Build Materials - You are responsible for your own build
							materials. As it will be a community hangar, all containers will
							be accesible by everyone. I recommend utilizing secure audit
							container to monitor inputs and outputs or only keeping what is
							needed for a particular build. Use at your own risk. To utilize a
							secure container, select the items in the container, right click
							them and select "Lock Item". The items can still be unlocked and
							taken by anybody, but the audit log will tell you WHO did it.
							NOTE: Theft from other players' container(s) will result in
							getting kicked from the Corporation.
						</p>

						<p>
							Build/Research Fees - The Corporation has made the Production
							wallet accessible to all for use in paying research and build
							fees. This is not a bottomless wallet and will periodically be
							added to if funds are available, but members are also asked to
							consider donating to the wallet to keep the magic going. NOTE:
							Theft from this wallet will result in getting kicked from the
							Corporation.
						</p>

						<p>
							- If you have empty/unused Industry research slots PLEASE consider
							donating their usage to helping research teh BPOs that OldGuyMonty
							has made available. Ultimately this benefits the corporation and
							you can use the Production wallet to pay the fees.
						</p>

						<p>
							BPO Gaps/Addition/Donation - If demand for a BPO becomes large or
							if there is a BPO that you would like to see added to the
							collection speak with OldGuyMonty. Consideration will be given (if
							funds are available) to him purchasing extra copies for people to
							research and utilize
						</p>

						<p>
							- The ability exists to deposit Blueprints into the collection as
							well (you will not be able to take them back out once they are put
							in) If there is a BPO gap that you would like to fill (you have a
							duplicate or are willing to purchase and donate) I will be happy
							to accept it into my collection. If you prefer that it go in as a
							Corp owned BPO make sure to let me know and I will add another
							hangar for corp owned BPOs. We have a few, but not many. NOTE:
							This is only for those rare generous souls and should, in no way,
							be considered a solicitation. (I"m answering the question before
							it can be asked)
						</p>

						<h3>BPC's (Blueprint Copies)</h3>
						<p>
							- There is also a folder of BPC's available for all to use. These
							are mostly the daily freebie blueprints, but there are occasional
							gems that end up in there is someone no longer needs a blueprint.
							Feel free to give and take at will from this container, just be
							courteous and only take what you intend to utilize.
						</p>

						<h3>Slot containers (Salvage)</h3>
						<p>
							- There are numerous containers available labeled for High/Mid/Low
							Slot. This is all salvage that has been collected and donated from
							mission running. This is to be used for outfitting throw-away
							ships for mining, testing fits, learning PVP, and so on. If you
							tend to collect everything and don't know what to do with it,
							consider donating it to the corp and sharing for others to use.
						</p>
						<p>
							- Actual Salvage Materials like Alloyed Tritanium Bar , Burned
							Logic Circuit , and Fried Interface Circuit can be donated to
							OldGuyMonty for use in building station rigs if you have no use
							for them.
						</p>
