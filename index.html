        <h2>Ding Dong, the war is gone</h2>
        <h5>OldGuyMonty, Aug 18, 2021</h5>
        <h3>All,</h3>
        <p>Just a fast update for those that are unaware. The war is ending. As with most of these things it's a matter of us paying them to go away. Sometimes it's "cheap". This time it wasn't. We managed to finalize things with them literally sitting in Nafrivik ready to start shooting. The amounts involved are irrelevant at this point, but it's more important than ever that we get out there and get to work. We have bills to pay and lights to keep on so that everyone has a place to live. We have some breathing room.</p>
        <h3>Things corp members can do to help:</h3>
        <h4>- MINING! (It's what we do)</h4>
        <p>Get out on the belts and start pulling in as much ore as you can. Veldspar is great, but Scordite and Pyroxeres are what we run short on most. Mine what you want, but keep those in mind.</p>
        <h4>- MOON MINING!</h4>
        <p>We have moon events scheduled for Saturday 8/28 at 01:00 game time on the   Siyi - Power Enema (Please don't shoot at POO) and  on 9/3 at 22:00 game time on the  Siyi - brown side of the moon (Please don't shoot at POO) . The more of this we mine ourselves, the more we can take to market and build a stronger Corp!</p>
        <h4>- PLANETARY INTERACTION</h4>
        <p>Planetary Infrastructure is easy to put in place and once it is in place it's free isk. We are always in need of components for building Fuel Blocks. If you're interested in helping reach out and I'll help you in the right direction.</p>
        <h4>- ICE MINING</h4>
        <p>Another part of fuel block production. It can be VERY Profitable</p>
        <h4>- MARKETPLACE</h4>
        <p>If you aren't aware, we have recently installed a marketplace on the  Nafrivik - Super Bowel (Market & Industry) (Please don't shoot at POO) . Now you can build and put it straight to market. We already have more inventory offered in our market than is avaialbe on  Nafrivik VIII - Moon 6 - Ministry of War Bureau Offices.</p>
        <h4>- SALVAGE</h4>
        <p>For you mission runners. If you're not already, PICK UP THAT SALVAGE! It's valuable. I hope to get us to the point where we can buy it like we do ore, but at a mininmum consider selling it for profit or donating it to the Corp!</p>
        <h4>- INDUSTRY</h4>
        <p>We now have an Invention module in  Nafrivik - Super Bowel (Market & Industry) (Please don't shoot at POO) so you can create T@ Blueprints if your skill levels are there.. We also have a rig onboard that reduces the build cost of ammo if you want to make and sell.</p>
        <h4>- RECRUITING</h4>
        <p>We NEED more members. Be sure to talk about Poo whenever you get the opportunity. Remember. Poo is good. Poo is wise. Poo is profitable (trust me, I work in the sewer industry - no joke there)</p>
        <p>Please, as always, reach out if you have any questions or if you would like to contribute more in some way!</p>

        <h2>Moon Popped in Siyi</h2>
        <h5>Moon Mining, Aug 15, 2021</h5>
        <h4>Here we go again!</h4>
        <p>Another moon has popped in Siyi and we have hit the jackpot! All rocks are "<u>Glistening</u>" which means they will provide a 2x reprocessing yield. Good for the Corp and great payouts to you. Come on out, because the ore goes fast!</p>
